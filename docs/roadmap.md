# Roadmap

## Current MVP

- Distinctive landing page with a runnable product preview.
- Local learning dashboard, path, activity, recommendations, and milestones.
- Three transaction introductions and knowledge checkpoints.
- Complete Duplicate Payment Callback sandbox: unsafe/protected modes, step/run/reset/replay, historical state, node inspection, committed records, rollback recovery, result evaluation, final quiz.
- Complete Lost Update sandbox: stale reads and unsafe replacements versus row-locked atomic increments, configurable write order and initial balance, step/run/reset/replay, historical state, record inspection, and a separate final quiz.
- Complete Deadlock sandbox: two-transaction wait-for graph, opposite/consistent lock ordering, staged debit rollback, configurable victim, one bounded whole-transaction retry, and a dedicated final quiz.
- English/Indonesian interface, all published database curriculum content, catalog metadata, quizzes, simulation explanations, guided diagram labels, and activity dates; a device-local language preference preserves learning state. Server metadata stays English.
- Device-local progress for six milestones, light/dark themes, responsive layout. Existing tests come from the initial MVP; follow the no-test policy in `AGENTS.md` for subsequent work.

## Database Engineering — database curriculum

The unified path `/learn/database-engineering` registers 10 levels, 40 modules and 120 canonical IDs. L0–L3 and L4M01–L4M03 provide 54 published bilingual lessons; 66 remain draft. Worked results, concept checks, practice variants/edge cases, hints, reflection and versioned progress use the existing player. Only L0–L2M01 have historical executed SQL evidence; later additions have source/diff review only. Practice predicts authored outcomes; the website does not execute learner SQL.

## Recommended next milestone: L4M04 authoring

L4M03 follows L4M02. L4 remains incomplete; its level assessment stays unavailable. Earlier completed levels keep their existing gates, and authored traces do not create a new simulator or production-safety credential.

Continue with L4M04 — Payments dan Idempotency: scoped business keys and payload conflicts, ledger versus mutable balance, and local exactly-once effects under duplicate delivery. Distinguish local atomic effects from external exactly-once delivery and signature verification. Preserve canonical IDs, content versions, fixture boundaries and learner progress. Use UML/ERD for structure, ordinary tables for data and React Flow for actual processes. Follow AGENTS.md: no tests/audits/SQL/runtime/browser/manual checks, lint, typecheck or build without explicit user authorization; review source/diff, commit, push and continue.

## Later learning improvements

- A compact Sandbox overview using the existing three-lab catalog.

- Expand meaningful accessibility checks and Safari/Firefox/mobile browser coverage.
- Distinguish reading completion from checkpoint mastery if the product needs both.
- Add more scheduling choices only when they teach a specific concept; keep runs reproducible.

## Production considerations, when needed

- Authentication and PostgreSQL-backed per-user progress, with migrations and recovery from local progress.
- Content editing/versioning, reviewed educational accuracy, operational monitoring, backups, and deployment policy.
- A real PostgreSQL adapter only if server experiments become a product requirement; isolate workloads, bound resources, and prevent arbitrary code execution by default.
- Real payment integrations would separately require verified gateway signatures, amount/currency reconciliation, authorization, audit controls, and operational idempotency. This educational model is not a payment handler to deploy.

No authentication, paid APIs, AI, Docker, real payment calls, or production infrastructure are included in the MVP.
